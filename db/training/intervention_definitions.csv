6474,Pre-teach Vocabulary,"Solving math problems in a relevant context allows the child to learn about computation in a naturally occurring and developmentally appropriate manner. If the student's vocabulary seems to be at issue, pre-teach the vocabulary using real objects.

6475,Make the Verb Active ,"Solving math problems in a relevant context allows the child to learn about computation in a naturally occurring and developmentally appropriate manner. If the language concept used seems to be at issue, change the verb to make the action more obvious, making it more likely that the student can visualize the problem.

6476,Teach Counting On Strategies,"Solving math problems in a relevant context allows the child to learn about computation in a naturally occurring and developmentally appropriate manner. If the student ""counts everything"" to solve problems, foster counting on strategies.

6477,Adjust Number Size to Within Student's Mental Computation Level,"Solving math problems in a relevant context allows the child to learn about computation in a naturally occurring and developmentally appropriate manner. If the student is using strategies that are not at grade level expectations, adjust the number choice to work within the student's mental computation level.  Continue to adjust numbers to build the student's knowledge.

6472,Place Value,"An understanding of place value includes three overlapping and interconnected ideas: An understanding of the relationship between numbers and groups of tens (46 = 6 ones and 4 tens); an understanding that the position of the digits indicates its value (367, the ""3"" means three hundreds); and the ability to compute multi-digit numbers accurately and efficiently with understanding (having an efficient accurate algorithm could include: tens and ones strategy, compensating strategy, incrementing strategy and standard algorithm). Activities that support the development of place value understanding include: Comparing Number Line Representation, Counting and Compare, and Nickname, Real Name. For directions and more ideas like these, see p. 130 in Learning Mathematics in the Primary Grades, and Ch. 4 and Ch. 7 in Learning Mathematics in the Intermediate Grades. For ideas about appropriate number ranges to use with the child see the Developmental Guidelines.  This intervention is intended to include a variety of activities over time, with gradual adjustments to the number size as the child progresses.",0,1491,781074649,782065165,8,680074761,4,,,0,1,2007-08-14 18:36:47,2008-09-29 19:23:25,,,
