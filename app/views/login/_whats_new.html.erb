      <b><a href="/cico/">Check in Check out (cicotest)</a></b> <br />
      <a href="/cico"/>This</a> is just a static form to review the structure of a potentially upcoming feature. <br />
      
      <b>District Documents (633)</b> <br />

      in the menu under "District Documents."
      <hr />
      <b>Behavior Referrals (619)</b> <br /> 
      This is just a placeholder.  Currently a district admin can assign a role and users with that role can see a link in their menu after picking a school.  <br />
      There's a template for the form, but this will change significantly.  
      <hr />
      <b>School Team and Consultation Form Attachments (604) </b> <br />
      The school administrator can assign attachments to school teams.  These can be instructions or a blank form. <br />
      A user creating a team consultation or responding to a request will see these attachments and can upload their own as well.  <br />
      A user can also hide the existng form, this is useful if they're uploading an attachment and ignoring the existing form.  <br />

      Select new Intervention and Progress Monitor from Menu, then choose Learning, Proficient Math.  <br />

      Choose the blue category, and when you click the select box for assign intervention you can see which one qualifies. <br />
      The SLD qualifying criteria are added to the description. <br />

      If a district chooses to lock their tiers (higher tiers cannot be completed for a student unless a recommendation or principal override is completed.) <br />
      They can now exempt goals, objectives, categories and intervention definitions in the builder.  If exempted, interventions in one of those exempted builders <br />
      will be available to students at any tier.  <br />
      <i>Note, the tier exemption in the builder is only available if the district has chosen to restrict tiers.   Otherwise it has no effect and is hidden from view.</i>
