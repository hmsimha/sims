  <h2>Virtual Groups </h2>
  <p>In a virtual group, the users are assigned by the School Administrator,
  but the sudents are assigned dynamically by SIMS.  The student assignments
  are based on enrollments. If a student is enrolled in a school, that student will
  belong to the "All Students In School" and their respective "All Students In Grade: X."
  When the enrollments change, the students in these groups will change automatically.
